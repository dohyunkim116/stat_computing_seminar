    "* `git branch --merged`: shows the branch that has merged in with currently checked out branch. Branches that show up here could be deleted with `git branch -d` because you have already incorporated the change and you will not lose your work.\n",
    "* `git branch --no-merged`: shows the branch that has not been merged in with currently checked out branch\n",

    "    * `git checkout <branch>` if you do not have this branch in the local repo and matches a branch on only one remote.\n",

    "### Pulling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pulling means fetch and then merge. Not recommended.\n",

    "* `git push origin --delete <branch>`: deletes remote branch that is now defunct. This only deletes the pointer from the server and the actual data are not deleted until the next garbage collection. Therefore, you might be able to recover the data before then.\n"
