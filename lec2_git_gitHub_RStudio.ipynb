    "\n",
    "Your file in the working directory is either ***tracked*** or ***untracked***. Every file that was committed previously is being tracked and if you make any edits to it, the git will detect that change. To see this:\n",
    "1. Type `git status` to see the status of `file.txt`. You shouldn't see anyting\n",

    "\n",
    "* ***IMPORTANT***. What happens if you modify staged files? Modify `file.txt` and check the status. You will see `file.txt` is marked both modified and staged. What is going on? If you commit at this point, what will be committed are the files that are staged, not the files that are moidfied most recently. Therefore, if you want to commit most recently modified files, you need to stage them. Check the status after you stage the modified files. Now, you will see modified files are staged and up for commit. Essentially, `git add` is a preview of the snapshot(commit) that will be taken and instructs git by saying \"add precisely this content to the next commit\" rather than \"add this file to the project” [1](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository).\n"
