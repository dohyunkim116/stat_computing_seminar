Therefore, if you want to commit most recently modified files, you need to stage them. Check the status after you stage the modified files. Now, you will see modified files are staged and up for commit. Essentially, `git add` is a preview of the snapshot(commit) that will be taken and instructs git by saying \"add precisely this content to the next commit\" rather than \"add this file to the project” [1](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository).\n"

    "* Branching allows you to test current working version of package/project quickly, efficiently and safely\n",
    "* Branch is just a [pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)) to a last commit object you have made when you committed.\n",
    "* A commit object is just a meta data file with a pointer to a tree object.\n",
    "    * The tree object has a collection of pointers to files (blobs).\n",
    "        * These files are the files that you took a snapshot or committed.\n",
    "        \n",
    "In picture:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/commit-and-tree.png\" /> \n",
    "\n",
    "* After a couple of commits, this is how the commits are organized. Notice each commit has a pointer named `parent` that points to a parent commit object:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/commits-and-parents.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* Suppose you want to creat a branch named `testing`. You type `git branch testing`. This creates a pointer, `testing`, that points to the lastest commit you are on:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/two-branches.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "* But how do we know which branch we are on? This is tracked by another pointer `HEAD` that points to a branch pointer of interest. Whichever `HEAD` branch is pointing to is the branch you are on and what your working directory is:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/head-to-master.png\" />\n",
    "You could check where the `HEAD` is pointing with `git log --decorate`.\n",
